# Functionalities to Achieve: 
- Read from the Python scripts the RS32 Module, and the data over the Umblical needs to be displayed onto the website
- Need to have 2 buttons to change the settings of the Relay modules
- Research about the async, await, promises and the differences between them since we cannot use threading as easily in Javascript. 
- Displaying the change of pressure and mass need to wait on the script. Can setup the empty endpoints in the meanwhile a dummy       Python script sleeps for 3 seconds and still be able to update the website and ensure it's not freezing and the data is being interrupted since something needs to be accomplished. The second button should change the color of the background. 
- Continuosly updating once running locally, try to not refresh the button everytime --> Completed by Kevin 
- Ensuring that anyone in the other sub teams can run this website not only just from Avionics Software
